    question: "What is a GPU and why is it important for gaming?",
    answer: "A GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a hardware component responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations on your screen. It is crucial for gaming as it handles complex graphics calculations, enabling smooth and high-quality visuals."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know which CPU is compatible with my motherboard?",
    answer: "To determine CPU compatibility, check your motherboard’s specifications for the supported socket type and chipset. You can also consult the motherboard manufacturer’s website or documentation for a list of compatible CPUs."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between SSD and HDD?",
    answer: "An SSD (Solid State Drive) uses flash memory to store data, providing faster read and write speeds compared to an HDD (Hard Disk Drive), which uses spinning disks and read/write heads. SSDs offer quicker boot times and improved overall performance."
  },
  {
    question: "How much RAM do I need for gaming?",
    answer: "For gaming, 16GB of RAM is generally recommended to ensure smooth performance. However, some games or multitasking scenarios might benefit from 32GB, especially if you plan to run additional applications alongside your games."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a power supply unit (PSU) and why is it important?",
    answer: "A power supply unit (PSU) converts electrical power from an outlet into usable power for your PC components. It is important because it provides the necessary power to run all your components reliably and safely, and choosing the right wattage is crucial to avoid potential damage or instability."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade my graphics card without replacing my power supply?",
    answer: "It depends on the power requirements of the new graphics card. If the new card requires more power than your existing PSU can provide, you will need to upgrade your PSU to ensure stable and reliable performance."
  },
  {
    question: "What is overclocking and is it safe?",
    answer: "Overclocking is the process of increasing the operating speed of your CPU or GPU beyond the manufacturer’s specifications to boost performance. While it can offer improved performance, it can also lead to higher temperatures and potential instability, so proper cooling and caution are advised."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose the right case size for my components?",
    answer: "When selecting a PC case, ensure it is compatible with the size of your motherboard (e.g., ATX, Micro-ATX), and check for adequate space for your GPU, cooling solutions, and additional components. Also, consider airflow and cable management features."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the benefits of liquid cooling over air cooling?",
    answer: "Liquid cooling systems typically offer better cooling performance and can be quieter than air cooling solutions. They are often preferred for high-performance CPUs and GPUs that generate significant heat. However, liquid cooling systems can be more complex and expensive."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I clean my PC components?",
    answer: "It is recommended to clean your PC components every 3 to 6 months to remove dust and debris that can accumulate and affect performance. Regular cleaning helps maintain optimal airflow and cooling efficiency, prolonging the lifespan of your components."
  },
  {
    question: "What components are essential for a graphic design workstation?",
    answer: "A graphic design workstation should include a powerful CPU, a high-end GPU with good color accuracy, ample RAM (16GB or more), a high-resolution monitor, and fast storage (SSD). These components ensure smooth operation of design software and efficient handling of large files."
  },
  {
    question: "How does a color-calibrated monitor benefit graphic designers?",
    answer: "A color-calibrated monitor provides accurate color representation, which is crucial for graphic designers to ensure their designs look as intended across different devices and print media. It helps in maintaining consistency and precision in color-critical work."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the shipping process for your orders?",
    answer: "We process and ship orders the same day if placed within our business hours: Monday to Friday from 9 AM to 6 PM and Saturday from 9 AM to 1 PM. Orders placed outside these hours will be processed on the next business day. You will receive a tracking number once your order has been shipped."
